## Summary 
Hangmanners is a web application that allows the user to play hangman only if they have manners! You can either click on the letters or say the letter you want. However, there's a catch. You have to say a word that the letter begins with. And you have to say please. For example if you want the letter A, you have to say "Apple Please". Saying a word allows the voice recognition to better differentiate all the letters.

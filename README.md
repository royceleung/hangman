## Summary 
HangManners is a web application that allows the user to play hangman only if they have manners! You can either click on the letters or say the letter you want. However, there's a catch. For accuracy, you should say a word that the letter begins with. And you have to say please. For example if you want the letter A, you should say "Apple Please" but you can also say "A Please" which might be misheard by the voice-recognition.
